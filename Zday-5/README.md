# 1 - The reason of not updating for 3 days 
### I did take a break for 3 days its the semester 
### I never take a real break from the day I start
### Watch AFCON (I'm a human after all )
# 2 - today was warming up and testing if I am still going on with the react course and if I still remember everything or need to start again. It's  good that im not in the deep dive I'm just in the first of the course (3h45min)
